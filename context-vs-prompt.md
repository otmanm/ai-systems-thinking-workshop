# Context vs. Prompt

**Core concept:** Prompting is what you type. Context is what AI needs to give you useful output.

Most people focus on prompting - finding clever phrases or tricks. This works sometimes but breaks often.

Context engineering focuses on structured inputs: audience, situation, goal, constraints, format. This works consistently.

## The 5-Part Context Framework

Every AI task needs these 5 pieces:

### 1. AUDIENCE
**Who is this for, and what do they care about?**

### 2. SITUATION  
**What's happening, and why does it matter?**

### 3. GOAL
**What outcome do we want?**

### 4. CONSTRAINTS
**What rules must we follow?**

### 5. FORMAT
**How should the output be structured?**

## Before/After Example

**Vague:** "Write an email to the client about the project delay."
→ Generic output, unusable

**Context-structured:** Include all 5 elements (audience, situation, goal, constraints, format)
→ Specific output, ship-ready

## Key Takeaway

Spend 2 minutes filling in the 5-part framework. You'll save 10 minutes of editing.
