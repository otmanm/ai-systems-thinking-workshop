# AI Systems Thinking Workshop

**A practical 2-hour workshop that teaches non-technical professionals how to think and work with AI like a systems engineer.**

No coding required. No prompt hacks. Just structured thinking, quality control, and reliable results.

---

## Who This Is For

This workshop is designed for:

- **L&D managers** building internal AI enablement programs
- **Product, operations, and marketing leaders** using AI in daily workflows  
- **Consultants and managers** who need reliable AI outputs, not demos

Delivered to 700+ professionals across EMEA (Startups & Fortune 500) with 73% sustained adoption rates.

## What Participants Learn in 2 Hours

By the end of this session, participants will:

✅ Frame AI tasks using **context, constraints, and intent** - not "better prompts"  
✅ Diagnose why AI outputs fail, drift, or produce generic results  
✅ Apply **4-Q thinking** to validate AI recommendations  
✅ Use simple quality control checklists before shipping AI work  
✅ Decide when AI should assist and when humans must intervene
