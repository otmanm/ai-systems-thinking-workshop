# Exercise 1: Context Framing

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Group size:** Individual or pairs

## Learning Objective

Transform a vague AI request into a structured context brief that produces reliable, specific results.

## The Problem

Most AI requests look like this:

> "Write an email to the client about the project delay."

This produces generic output because the AI is missing:
- Who is the client?
- What caused the delay?
- What outcome do we want?
- What tone is appropriate?
- What constraints apply?

**Result:** Generic email requiring full rewrite.

## The Framework: 5-Part Context Brief

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Audience** | Who is this for? | "CFO of mid-size SaaS, values transparency" |
| **Situation** | What's happening? | "Phase 2 delayed 3 weeks, vendor API changes" |
| **Goal** | What outcome? | "Maintain trust, propose timeline, get approval" |
| **Constraints** | What rules? | "Max 200 words, professional but warm" |
| **Format** | How structured? | "Email: subject, 3 paragraphs, yes/no question" |

## Your Task

### Step 1: Analyze the Bad Request (3 min)

> "Create a summary of our Q3 performance for the board meeting."

**Question:** What context is missing? List 3+ things.

### Step 2: Build the Context Brief (7 min)

Use the [Context Brief Template](../templates/context-brief-template.md) to rewrite with all 5 elements.

**Scenario:** Board is concerned about customer churn. Q3 revenue flat, but retention program showing early results.

### Step 3: Compare Outputs (5 min)

Run BOTH prompts:
- Vague version
- Context-structured version

**Discussion:** Which output could you actually use?

## Key Takeaway

**Longer prompts ≠ better quality.**  
**Structured context = better quality.**

Time investment: 2 minutes of context planning saves 10 minutes of rewriting.
