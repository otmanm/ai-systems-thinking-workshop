## Quick Decision

**Is this going to someone outside your immediate team?**
- ☑️ Yes (clients, leadership, external) → Complete full checklist
- ☐ No (just you/teammates) → Skip to Risk Check only

| ☐ Situation: Addresses actual scenario vs. generic? | |
| ☐ Goal: Achieves what I need? | |
| ☐ Constraints: Follows length/tone/format rules? | |
| ☐ Format: Structured as requested? | |

| ☐ Facts: All numbers, dates, names correct? | |
| ☐ No hallucinations: AI didn't invent info? | |
| ☐ Complete: All required elements present? | |

## Section 3: Risk Check (1 min) ⚠️

**If ANY risk fails → DO NOT SEND**

## Section 4: 4-Q Thinking Test (2 min)

1. **Most confident assumption about this output?**
2. **Opposite view that challenges it?**
3. **If this failed, what would be the reason?**
4. **What am I not asking?**

## Action Decision

- ☐ Ship as-is
- ☐ Light edits needed
- ☐ Major revision
- ☐ Discard (AI not right tool)

---

**Time investment:** 8-10 min full checklist, 2-3 min risk check only  
**Time saved:** Hours of damage control from bad output
